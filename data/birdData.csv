-EDIT
I was originally not 100% confident of the ID, but it was confirmed as such the next day.  Thanks Eric and Jay!

Original note:
This is either a  Western Wood-Pewee (Contopus sordidulus) or Eastern Wood-Pewee (Contopus virens).  
I recorded it as it called from the top of a tall tree, in the evening just before sunset.
Western is far more likely at this location, however the call seems atypical for this species.  I have heard Eastern Wood-Pewees which gave a call similar to this.

An Anna's Hummingbird vocalized nearby. The habitat was an open large Oregon White Oak and grass area with pioneering Western Juniper which still left the area open. I did not note the smaller brush. It preferred the elderberry, but rested atop most prominent tops of small to medium sized bushes, shrubs, and trees.  It vocalized quite often, and seemed to have the same amount of time vocalizing as periods of silence. It did not sing, but its vocals were only the single note whistles as heard on this recording.

Two individuals observed in act of copulation. Bird on top ""dismounted"" and sat very closely beside bird on the bottom. Then the bird formerly on bottom jumped on top and started copulating, this time with the positions reversed! This second copulation was briefer and less coordinated, but still appeared to be a copulation attempt. 

After this head-scratching event, both birds separated and one began to sing this VERY quiet, fast and repetitive whisper song. It is unclear which of the two copulating individuals was the one vocalizing.
