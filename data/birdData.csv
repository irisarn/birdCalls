-EDIT
I was originally not 100% confident of the ID, but it was confirmed as such the next day.  Thanks Eric and Jay!

Original note:
This is either a  Western Wood-Pewee (Contopus sordidulus) or Eastern Wood-Pewee (Contopus virens).  
I recorded it as it called from the top of a tall tree, in the evening just before sunset.
Western is far more likely at this location, however the call seems atypical for this species.  I have heard Eastern Wood-Pewees which gave a call similar to this.

Edit: Thanks for the informative comments, Andrew!  I decided to list this under Pacific-Slope Flycatcher so that it may be found in search results, though as [Andrew Rush](http://www.xeno-canto.org/forum/topic/9325) points out, it is very likely genetically admixed and intermediate in song between Pacific-Slope and Cordilleran flycatchers.",song,//www.xeno-canto.org/181813/download,181813.mp3

First heard while conducting point count survey. I did not see the bird. Returned approx. one-half hour later and saw the bird atop a large yellow-flowering elderberry bush/small tree. It was preening and seemingly easily approachable. I took photos at first. Returned with fLIP camera and made one recording. I observed at close range its black plumage, crest, and red irises. An Anna's Hummingbird vocalized nearby. The habitat was an open large Oregon White Oak and grass area with pioneering Western Juniper which still left the area open. I did not note the smaller brush. It preferred the elderberry, but rested atop most prominent tops of small to medium sized bushes, shrubs, and trees.  It vocalized quite often, and seemed to have the same amount of time vocalizing as periods of silence. It did not sing, but its vocals were only the single note whistles as heard on this recording.
