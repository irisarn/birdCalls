# birdCalls
final project!

# Problem: What bird do I hear?

### [Dataset](https://www.xeno-canto.org/explore/api)
### [Sound Classification using Deep Learning](https://medium.com/@mikesmales/sound-classification-using-deep-learning-8bc2aa1990b7)

## Ideal Solution: 
* ML tool that can identify bird species based on bird call
* Demonstrating application of ML skills
* Validating accuracy of ML tool with classification accuracy score
* Use ML tool to classify birds in data set
* Show process and findings on an HTML page (or Tableau?)
* STRETCH GOAL: prompt google search and display image or info on bird species
* Display frequency of bird species on map tooltip/mouseover functions that give more specs for each species 



## Technological considerations:
* Audio data will have to be transformed using Librosa and Pandas
* Sklearn and Keras will be used for ML stuff once raw data has been filtered and transformed 
* Leaflet/HTML/JavaScript are all applicable (especially for creating interactive map) 

## Task Allocation for now: 
* Jasmin and Luisa are working on API calls/ data cleaning 
* Iris is starting to explore how to convert audio files 
* Harmony is starting on map!
